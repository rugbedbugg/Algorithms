This repository contains **algorithm implementations** written as part of learning and revising core problem-solving techniques.

The focus here is on **understanding the logic behind algorithms**, not just producing correct output.

Most solutions are written step by step, keeping the thought process visible rather than compressed.

## Contents

* Standard algorithms and data structures
* Dynamic Programming (with states made explicit)
* Greedy and recursive approaches
* Graph algorithms and classic problems
* Multiple approaches where useful (brute force to optimized)

The code is structured to be readable and revisitable, especially during revision.

## Tools & Languages

* Primarily **C / C++**
* Standard libraries only
* No external dependencies

## Purpose

This repository serves as:

* A personal reference for algorithms
* A revision aid for exams, interviews, and practice
* A place to experiment with different approaches to the same problem

It is **not** meant to be a competitive programming template library.

## Notes

* Solutions may be longer than necessary for clarity
* Variable names and comments prioritize understanding
* Optimization is secondary to correctness and explanation
